# Community Pipeline

## Contribution metrics
- Jess metrics
- Fernando example metrics

## "Overview of Jupyter"
- have an "overview of jupyter" page (similar to Carol Willing's http://doc_helper.iheartjupyterdocs.org/ page)
- include a dependency chain of which jupyter projects depend on each other
- check matrix of the above that stays up to date over the project's evolution.

## Development Guide
Comprehensive development guide with quickstart instructions (see python
development guide as an example: https://docs.python.org/devguide/)

## Repo maintainer checklist
- [ ] separate user and development installation instructions
- [ ] how to install non-python dependencies
- [ ] how to run tests
- [ ] how to build docs

## Issue courtesy and responsiveness
- be friendly/enthusiastic/thoughtful in replying to issues
- for PRs that will be rejected, e.g. (pep8 changes), have a canned reply that is a thoughtful rejection as opposed to just "no"
- tell people thanks
- highlight what is good in their PR
- give people emoji thanks

### Issue response checklist
- [ ] Be friendly, enthusiastic, thoughtful
- [ ] Say thanks
- [ ] Highlight good point(s) in the PR
- [ ] If PR will be rejected, have a canned thoughtful reply
- [ ] Offer suggestion of a next issue if contributor is interested

## Issue triage and management
- grant more people with the ability to label issues
- have a bot that can take actions on those issues based on the labels
  (e.g. if labeled "duplicate", the issue will be automatically closed)
- use the new github emoticon issue support and encode some semantics on it.

## Mentorship mailing list
- for new contributors to ask questions
- less pressure than emailing the main mailing list (Python core one:
  https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/core-mentorship)

## Newsletter
- recognizing maintainers and contributors in the newsletter
- have a "maintainer of the month" (someone with commit bits) -- put a human
  face on the people maintaining jupyter projects
- have a "contributor of the month" (someone without commit bits) -- recognize
  new contributors and nights-and-weekend contributors
- including a list of new contributors
